# Tutorials

Tutorials provide users with helpful scripts and functions, and explain the code step by step. Each tutorial is numbered and located in its own subdirectory. Each tutorial consists of

1. a README-file explaining the code,
2. a Python script containing the code,
3. additional files, e.g. an .eaf-file containing language data.

While not mandatory, it is recommended to **start with the first two tutorials** and learn how to (1) set up Python and Corflow, and (2) use Corflow, since all additional functions provided by the repository use Corflow.

* [First tutorial](./00_getting_started/): Setup Python and Corflow
* [Second tutorial](./01_corflow_basics/): Corflow Basics

The rest of the tutorials can be done in any order.
