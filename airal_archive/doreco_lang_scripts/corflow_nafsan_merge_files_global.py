# Script written by Aleksandr Schamberger as part of the AIRAL project by Ludger Paschen at ZAS Berlin
# Corflow module created by Francois Delafontaine

'''
The following script takes pairs (or triples) of eaf-files, where each file contains one speaker with his/her tiers (previously, both speakers shared the same tiers in an original file, before they got their own tiers in their separate files). All tiers of speakers 02 and 03 get copied and inserted to those of speaker 01, thereby merging the tiers of all speakers. Each transcription gets saved in a new eaf-file.
